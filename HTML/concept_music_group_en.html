<h1>Music group</h1>
A musical group is a collective of people united by a common goal or work, who are somehow connected with music. Usually a musical group consists of musicians, but it may also include other musical figures (producers, sound engineers) or people who are not directly involved in the creation of music (artists, poets, technicians).
